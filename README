                             Heart Rate Monitor
                             ------------------

   Description

      This is a Heart Rate Monitor app for use with ANT+ Heart Rate Sensors
      on the Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) platform.

      Rather than other apps that simply report the current heart rate and a
      final average, Heart Rate Monitor will provide beat-by-beat logging and
      reporting, including session performance statistics.
